# Bladelink

Bladelink is an immersive action-adventure game where a young protagonist is bound to a mystical blade through supernatural ties. Traverse diverse landscapes, engage in combat, and wield supernatural powers to overcome adversaries.

## Overview

Bladelink draws inspiration from the fluid movement of games like Dead Cells or Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice while incorporating a unique combat system centered around the protagonist's connection to a mystical blade. Developed in Unity using C#, this project was initiated when I was 16, showcasing both my passion for game development and my technical skills at a young age.

## Key Features

- **Fluid Traversal:** Navigate through the game world with dynamic movements, including jumping, climbing ledges, and other agile actions.
- **Combat Mechanics:** Engage enemies with sword attacks, parrying, and the ability to deflect incoming strikes for strategic advantage.
- **Supernatural Abilities:** Use the protagonist's supernatural connection to the blade to throw it at enemies, recall it, or teleport to its location, adding depth to combat strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity Game Engine:** Leveraged Unity's powerful features to create a seamless gaming experience
- **C# Programming:** Implemented game logic, mechanics, AI and interactions using C# (inside Bladelink/Assets/Scripts)
