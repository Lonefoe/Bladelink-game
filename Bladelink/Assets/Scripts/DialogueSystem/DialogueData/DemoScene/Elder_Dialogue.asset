  - It indeed is very different around here.
  - Do I know you?
  - No, I'm sure I don't.
  - You're a traveller, aren't you?
  - I've seen the likes of you. Many have wandered through these lands.
  - Each one having their own story.
  - Whatever your story may be, I sense some great courage in you.
  - But also irresponsibility. We will see how your journey will continue.
  - I'll be watching.
